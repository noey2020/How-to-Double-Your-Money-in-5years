How to Double your Money in 5 years!

I spent more than tens of hours reading, researching, and studying. I guarantee you
will get lots of advises and they can be pretty astounding and confusing, as well!
Here's what I found.

To double it in 5 years means, it must grow 14.4% compounded interest annually!

Invest or trade. Day trading in stocks is a lot of hard work and time. If you still 
want to keep your day job, I would suggest you do passive investing for $500 or some 
even suggested $20.

I know you don't want to lose your money and you want to increase your chances of
winning.

Be smart, do your homework and roll that $500.

Getting listed in the stock exchange is no easy feat. From a start-up business needing
capital to grow, it has to demonstrate it has grown its sales and revenues or has 
the potential to grow. When it has done that, if it wants to go public to raise
capital it can attract investors and venture capitalists.

You said, I will start investing. You already know that a low P/E ratio
is generally better than a high P/E ratio, that a company with a lot of cash on its
balance sheet is superior to one burdened with debt, and that analysts' recommendations
should always be taken with a grain of salt. And you know the cardinal rule of the
smart investor: A portfolio should be diversified across multiple sectors.

So picking stocks to buy, I would target an industry. I know I have to inspect the 
financial statements of the companies I want to analyze. But there are tens of thousands
of stocks to choose from. I have to identify companies that have a favorable net debt
position and are improving their net margins. Honestly, I am overwhelmed not even starting.

We have stock screeners. We can study and duplicate the safe blue-chip stocks strategies
of successful investors. Let me move away from a famous company like apple. We want to
target growth companies with potential for profit.

1. Look for companies demonstrating growth like double digits. 
2. Look at their margins.
3. I use Fidelity Research to pull up public documents so I can make technical analysis,
   fundamental analysis, charts, and price analysis.
4. Look at earnings per share, EPS, market values, debt to equity ratios, cash flow.
5. Look at stock price performance, dividends, etc.
6. Listen to relevant business news.
7. Make your list and rank how you want to bet on your money, get quote. Dont' worry about
   the ups and downs for the next 5 years.
8. You just made a smart investment decision.
9. Relax and enjoy life and see you in the next 5 years with double money!

"Thoughts for the Day" - Invest or Trade

I do passive investing with Roth IRA which has zero interest rate, tax-free if you don't withdraw before 60. If I diversify into TD, interest rate is at most 5% whereas stock trading is historically 9%. If I have $500 I can use to trade without having to worry or lose sleep if I lose it, I will either choose the S&P500 or DJIA. There are many free charts to study your investment strategy. Now is the time to trade before stock prices go up with vaccine companies and reap rewards. I would select these online stock sites: TD Ameritrade, TradeStation, E*TRADE, Merrill Edge, and Fidelity. 

If I buy with 500 let it roll for 30 years, it will be 500,000 dollars, without help of spreadsheet ðŸ˜Š

You can do this while having a day job. Passive investing is whenever in your paycheck you have deductions for ira or roth ira. But if you want to earn more, you can do it yourself or through a broker. DIY means determining your risk tolerance. Are you risk averse or risk ok? Is $500 something you can use to win or lose without too much stress. For starters, the S&P(more diverse meaning safer) and DJIA(more focused on top 30 industrial) are indices to help you make a strategy. You can make an initial purchase, let it roll undeterred for the ups and downs, trading daily, or trading every week or once in a while. Or, use the services of stock brokers but they make money commissions. DIY means putting time and effort researching whether the charts or your gut feel tells you. You will have to learn the ABCs of financial accounting, financial statement analysis like financial ratios. One ratio is debt to equity. The published debt to equity in financial reports like 2 is okay meaning higher ratio indicates less solvency or having higher ratio is not good. Overall, it will depend on your overall judgement using many ratios plus experience plus "hunch". Emerging markets give the best returns. I have $500 to spare. My two cents. ðŸ˜Š
