How to Double your Money in 5 years!

I spent more than tens of hours reading, researching, and studying. I guarantee you
will get lots of advises and they can be pretty astounding and confusing, as well!
Here's what I found.

To double it in 5 years means, it must grow 14.4% compounded interest annually!

Invest or trade. Day trading in stocks is a lot of hard work and time. If you still 
want to keep your day job, I would suggest you do passive investing for $500 or some 
even suggested $20.

I know you don't want to lose your money and you want to increase your chances of
winning.

Be smart, do your homework and roll that $500.

Getting listed in the stock exchange is no easy feat. From a start-up business needing
capital to grow, it has to demonstrate it has grown its sales and revenues or has 
the potential to grow. When it has done that, if it wants to go public to raise
capital it can attract investors and venture capitalists.

You said, I will start investing. You already know that a low P/E ratio
is generally better than a high P/E ratio, that a company with a lot of cash on its
balance sheet is superior to one burdened with debt, and that analysts' recommendations
should always be taken with a grain of salt. And you know the cardinal rule of the
smart investor: A portfolio should be diversified across multiple sectors.

So picking stocks to buy, I would target an industry. I know I have to inspect the 
financial statements of the companies I want to analyze. But there are tens of thousands
of stocks to choose from. I have to identify companies that have a favorable net debt
position and are improving their net margins. Honestly, I am overwhelmed not even starting.

Don't start from a famous company like apple. We want to target growth companies with
potential for profit.

1. Look for companies demonstrating growth like double digits. 
2. Look at their margins.
3. I use Fidelity Research to pull up public documents so I can make technical analysis,
   fundamental analysis, charts, and price analysis.
4. Look at earnings per share, EPS, market values, debt to equity ratios, cash flow.
5. Look at stock price performance, dividends, etc.
6. Listen to relevant business news.
7. Make your list and rank how you want to bet on your money, get quote. Dont' worry about
   the ups and downs for the next 5 years.
8. You just made a smart investment decision.
9. Relax and enjoy life and see you in the next 5 years with double money!
